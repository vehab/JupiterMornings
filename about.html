              Hello! I go by "the JMC" and I created jupitermornings.com to share the different projects I take on throughout my life.  After trying to sort through my old photos from college, I realized that I did a lot of cool stuff then but I didn't have any other form of record of my experiences except those photos.
            </p>
            <p>
              It got me thinking about how time, as far as I perceive it, keeps going forward and that the larger the time period between my past experiences and my current state grows, the less I remember.  Taking pictures while living through those experiences only adds so much to the memories. I want more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, Jupiter Mornings exists. Jupiter Mornings is the largest project I will be working on as it encompasses recording the progress of all the smaller projects.  There is no goal other than to keep an extensive record of what I am doing in my life as it is happening. To do this, I will be utilizing as many mediums as necessary. In addition to this website, Jupiter Mornings content is also available on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
