            </div>
            <p>I didnâ€™t always understand what a new years resolution was.  When I was old enough where new year's resolutions became a topic of discussion, I understood them to be promises you make to yourself for the new year but everyone hated them because they were supposed to be broken by February.  New year's resolutions seemed to be the most awful thing that ever happened to people and I didn't understand why people did that to themselves. </p>
            <p>Most of the articles I read on new year's resolutions told stories of resolution failures but some of them shined light on the subject.  These informative articles discussed how new year's resolutions are just goals one sets for oneself with the change of the new year. They went into detail about how goals need to have certain characteristics to be attainable and sustainable.  It was through these articles that the SMART criteria for developing goals really sunk into my understanding of what a new years resolution could be and how to avoid being miserable about failures mid February.</p>
            <p>In short, the SMART acronym stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. So to ensure any goals you set for yourself can be accomplished, just follow the SMART criteria for developing them.</p>
            <p>One of the first new year's resolutions I made was to wash my face each night with a cleanser. This was around the time I was getting into wearing makeup and washing my face each night with something other than just water became a necessity. I held onto that resolution really well and I continued that habit into present day. It was a specific goal (wash my face with a cleanser), measurable (did I wash my face or not), achievable (it literally took 5 minutes of my night time routine to do it), relevant (I wanted to keep my skin healthy, so washing it with a cleanser was important), and time-bound (do it for one year, the new year).</p>
            <p>That first new years resolution was ages ago and I've stepped up my new years resolution game since then.</p>
            <p>This year, I want to work on accomplishing the following goals:</p>
	          <ol>
              <li><p>Be more mindful every day</p></li>
              <li><p>Continue maintaining a healthy level of physical activity</p></li>
              <li><p>Actively work on developing and maintaining my personal relationships with my family and friends</p></li>
              <li><p>Publish a new blog post and YouTube video each month</p></li>
              <li><p>Continue expanding my breadth and depth of knowledge in the area of computer science</p></li>
              <li><p>Rework my clothing spending habits by buying ethically made, and when possible, American made clothing</p></li>
              <li><p>Continue nourishing my body by eating good, wholesome, nutritious food</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now, I want to go into detail about how, and to what extent, I want to accomplish these goals.</p>
            <p><strong>Be more mindful every day</strong></p>
            <p>This is a difficult thing to admit but for a couple of years now I had been living my life on autopilot. The days went by and though I did things within those days like starting a workout routine, finishing my engineering undergraduate degree, and becoming employed, I, for the most part, felt devoid of any emotions and feelings. It started in 2013 with the ending of a relationship that was important to me; that end left me feeling very empty and for a while I didn't know who I was anymore. It's a strange thing to think about, "how do you not know who you are?", but I was in that boat. And I guess the best way to describe that feeling is not being able to answer questions like "what do you like to do in your free time?", "what do you see yourself doing in ten years?", "what are you passionate about?". My understanding of the world and what was significant to me was completely turned around in a three dimensional sense and I felt like I was in some form of conscious limbo.</p>
            <p>It was a while before I could put a word to what was happening to me. Dissociation; the disconnection or separation of something from something else or the state of being disconnected. I was going through the daily motions of what I knew I needed to do but my eyes and mind were unfocused wherever I looked. I was on autopilot.</p>
            <p>With the closing of my undergraduate studies and the start of my employment, I've been starting to find my focus again. It was the strangest thing, the day I felt like I had that mental clarity and focus I lost long ago. I was walking to one of my work locations after having visited the dentist with a coffee in one hand, my planner in the other, and to-do list on my mind of everything I had to get done that day. I knew something was different because my gait was more powerful than usual but also more relaxed. I had places to be and things to do, but I knew everything that was thrown at me, I would be able to handle. And then I remember thinking, "This is who you are." A laundry list of my past struggles came barreling through my mind and the corresponding solutions and successes followed. "This is who I am." I can handle everything that comes my way. I am strong. I am capable. I can do this.</p>
            <p>And that day changed everything for me. It was the first day in two or three years where I felt like I was back in the game and I could feel again. I wanted to live again. I wanted to get thrown in the way of everything I passed instead of side stepping it. Whereas before I would cast my eyes down during human interactions, now I wanted to look everyone in the eye and know everything that was going on. I felt alive again and it felt good.</p>
            <p>Now, I realize that this spike in energy for life may have been due to the coffee since I didn't typically drink it and my caffeine consumption was relatively low. But, it felt great! And I want to keep feeling that way! That's why I'm making a concerted effort to be more present in my day to day, to step in the way of everything that comes my way and inspect it before I let it pass, to truly engage with everyone around me, and to fully live life.</p>
            <p>To do this, I am slowing myself down. Whereas I would rush out of the door in the morning to get to work earlier so I could leave earlier, I'm taking the time to eat breakfast at home, to think about the makeup look I want to wear that day, to create that make up look, to put on clothes that make me feel great, and to cross all the t's and dot all the i's around my apartment before I leave for the day. Then at work, I make sure to write down the tasks I have to get done that day and make a concerted effort to get them done and get them done in a sequential order. I've done this "slowing down" for a few days now and I can already feel the positive impact it has had on me in terms of feeling more present in my life and feeling a more whole life experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Continue maintaining a healthy level of physical activity</strong></p>
            <p>In 2013, when I started being on autopilot, I decided to start working out during my two hour break in between afternoon classes. I continued that daily workout habit into May of 2015 when I graduated from college and only stopped because I was well deserving of a break. Since moving to Melbourne, I'd started getting back into working out but it was no where near the level of routine that it was in undergrad and I didn't set specific goals for myself.</p>
            <p>Thus, with the new year, I want to work on the following physical health metrics:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>Be able to run a half marathon under 3 hours for the Space Coast Marathon in late November</p></li>
              <li><p>Lift weights or work on other strength training at least two times a week</p></li>
              <li><p>Incorporate at least two HIIT style workouts into my weekly routine</p></li>
              <li><p>Stretch adequately after each workout</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Actively work on developing and maintaining my personal relationships with my family and friends</strong></p>
            <p>During undergrad, I let a lot of my personal relationships deteriorate due to the high amount of stress I was going through. I know I wasn't the best daughter, sister, or friend during that time and I want to change that about myself this year and for every year from here on out.  So, to be a better daughter, sister, and friend, I want to work on the following:</p>
	          <ol>
              <li><p>Text and Skype my parents at least once a week</p></li>
              <li><p>Text to check-in with my sisters at least once a week</p></li>
              <li><p>Interact with my friends via easy social media platforms like Snapchat as often as I can to keep them in the loop</p></li>
              <li><p>Whenever possible, fly out to see my family and friends and spend quality time with them</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Publish a new blog post and YouTube video each month</strong></p>
            <p>This goal is going to be one of the tougher ones for me to achieve. I made Jupiter Mornings when I was taking part in a very slow project at work that didn't require much of my brain power so I wanted something extra to stretch and work my mind. My time with that project is finished and I've been moved to a different project that actually taxes my brain. On the one hand, I'm happy about working on this new project because it's a fun, new challenge, and on the other hand, I know I won't be as inclined to take on extra projects after work like I was with the previous project.</p>
            <p>Regardless, however, I do want to continue working on my own skills and knowledge base so Jupiter Mornings will continue. I may end up publishing a new blog post and YouTube video at the end of every month, but I will get to it!  To do this, I will bring out my large table schedule and record all of my life events leading up for this year (stuff like travelling plans, doctor's appointments, etc.) and then establish a weekend where I am free to work on Jupiter Mornings. I'll also fill in specific dates to work on side projects and set up deadlines and reminders for myself to get them done.</p>
            <p><strong>Continue expanding my breadth and depth of knowledge in the area of computer science</strong></p>
            <p>I think one of my favorite lines said in college was something like, "I donâ€™t know how a computer works." Though I've been using these machines since my age was in the single digits, there are a lot of unanswered questions I have about computers that I'd like to not be ignorant about anymore. So, this year, I am tasking myself with completing the CS50x course via edX by the beginning of May. I have until the end of the year to complete it so if things don't go as planned within the three month time span, it's not a big deal, I can still finish it. Knowing me and my procrastination, however, if I'm told something isn't due until the end of the year, I probably wont start it until December 27th and I don't want to do that with this project.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as I learn more about the subject, I want to complete the different problems sets with a focus on solving problems associated with wearable health technology. Then, once I hit May and I've completed the course, I will reevaluate my skill set and determine the next course or project to take on to improve my knowledge further.</p>
            <p><strong>Rework my clothing spending habits by buying ethically made, and when possible, American made clothing</strong></p>
            <p>I like pretty things. I like wearing pretty things. I do not like my pretty things to come with the price tag of someone else suffering deeply. So, I've decided that moving forward in this year, I will buy ethically made, and when possible, American made clothing. You know, keep it within the fam fam. This is going to be a tough one for me, not because I think others' suffering is a worthwhile reason to buy something, rather, I'm really picky when it comes to clothes and now my selection is even more so limited. I do think that this goal will change my style, mainly embracing more patterns and also more simple pieces, but I'm ready for it.</p>
            <p>I will keep all of my existing wardrobe because I don't see the point in throwing it all out to buy a completely new wardrobe when the deed has been done and it's already been bought. The important thing for me now is to shop with ethical companies and take a little more time in thinking about the supply chain for the clothes I wear everyday.</p>
            <p><strong>Continue nourishing my body by eating good, wholesome, nutritious food</strong></p>
            <p>The more I experience life and develop a larger data set for how I react to things, the more I realize that food is not just a source of fuel. It impacts my body in a multitude of ways and my body has ways of letting me know what works best for it and what doesn't. For example, soy products have horrendous effects on my system. How do I know? Well, whenever I consume some type of soy product, such as edamame, my face breaks out in acne and when I don't consume those products, it's relatively clear.</p>
            <p>Thus, this year I want to work on the following:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><p>Consume more vegetables that my body can handle</p></li>
              <li><p>Decrease my dairy consumption to small splashes of cream in my coffee and cheese in my salads</p></li>
              <li><p>Continue to eat a low-carb diet (I don't count macros but the general avoidance of starchy foods is my goal)</p></li>
              <li><p>Cook and bake the large majority of the food I consume</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The month of January has already passed and I have taken up these goals throughout that time.  Moving forward, I want to keep better tabs on my progress with these goals and record what works to accomplish my goals and what doesn't work. To better todays and tomorrows to come; here here!</p>
