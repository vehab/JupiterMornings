              </div>
              <h3>Why</h3>
              <p>I created JupiterMornings because I wanted to have a project I could work on for a long time, documentation of the evolution of my abilities and knowledge base, and the ability to share it with others. A blog based website with video content seemed like the best way to go and so that's what I'm doing.  If it turns out that it's not the best way to go then I'll figure out what is, document everything along the way, and still meet my goals stated above. </p>
              <h3>How</h3>
              <h4>Step 1: Decide on hard "wants"</h4>
              <p>There were several things I knew I wanted with JupiterMornings that guided my decisions. I wanted full control of my website's layout, content, and advertisements so I opted for  a paid hosting service as opposed to a free hosting service. I did research into which hosting service would be the best for me; contenders included BlueHost, and SiteGround.  Since JupiterMornings is a small project right now, I decided to look into the basic, least expensive service of each contender so if it didn't work out, I wouldn't lose out on a huge investment.  I ended up choosing SiteGround because it had satisfactory reviews. After several months, I am still happy with my decision.  They have great customer support and the price-point is something I am comfortable with.</p>
              <p>A point to be made about hosting service reviews is that some people get a kickback if you signup using their referral code.  This is not inherently bad and if you sign up with certain hosting companies, you can do the same exact thing.  Just remember that some people will tone down (or completely ignore) criticism of a service so they can maximize their profits.</p>
              <h4>Step 2: Learn necessary skill set</h4>
              <p>Throughout my research into which hosting service I wanted to use, I began learning HTML and CSS.  For a quick review, HTML is a language in which your website's skeleton is written and CSS is the language that makes it look the way you want it to look. I used a really great website called CodeCademy.com to learn these languages and I cannot recommend it enough. CodeCademy is free to use but also provides a paid CodeCademy Pro service. It's typical for the free version of a service to be lacking in all the things the paid version provides but that isn't the case with CodeCademy. CodeCademy started off as an incredible and free service and, as far as I know/have been using the service, only just recently started providing the optional CodeCademy Pro service. Furthermore, CodeCademy doesn't just have courses on HTML and CSS, you can also learn JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, Python, Ruby, and several more.</p>
              <p>After completing the HTML and CSS course and the "Make a Website" course on CodeCademy and buying my website, I took a wrong turn (in hindsight of course).</p>
              <h4>Step 3: Make mistakes</h4>
              <p>After reading several introductory SiteGround tutorials, I downloaded Wordpress to my site. I was mistaken in thinking that what I wanted to do, which was create the HTML and CSS for my website, was going to be accomplished using some type of special content manager like Wordpress. Wordpress is great if you have a template already created for your website, if you want someone else to create the template for your website, and/or if you don't want to get too involved with the markup language of your website. None of those applied to me so I uninstalled Wordpress and continued looking elsewhere.</p>
              <h4>Step 4: Fix your mistakes</h4>
              <p>A little after I had realized I had gone down the wrong path, one of the lecture series I was watching at the time, the Harvard CSCI E-1 2011, had a video on Website Development that helped turn me back in the right direction.  I kept crawling around on YouTube until I found the YouTube channel "LearnCode.academy" that really helped me get going on the path I knew I wanted to be on.  To clarify, as far as I know, this YouTube channel is not affiliated with the CodeCademy website mentioned earlier. It's still really great, though, and I would encourage anyone interested in web development and the like to subscribe to it.</p>
              <p>So what was the right path for me? The path I wanted to be on involved writing my own HTML, utilizing the bootstrap framework for the underlining CSS, and then on top of that, specifying my own CSS for certain things. After I had done all the markup for my website, I wanted to be able to securely upload it to my website's server and then BAM! The website would look the way I wanted it to.</p>
              <p>The HTML, CSS, and bootstrap knowledge base was already developed from the CodeCademy learning courses but I had no clue how I was going to upload the website I had created on my computer to the internet. </p>
              <p>After more YouTube crawling, cue in this fabulous video: https://youtu.be/vmekjPhQuCc. I would use FlightPlan to upload my files to my website's machine securely over SSH (Secure Shell) and get my BAM! moment. That was of course, after I learned how to use GitHub, how to run the command line, and repeatedly run into problems with how my machine was set up (I had to download Xcode again, do some clean up on my bash profile, and other things). From these mishaps,  a very important lesson was further solidified for me: Google it until you fix it and if you can't find it on Google, improve your Googling skills and try again.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, learning Git and the command line was simple because CodeCademy has courses on those subjects and my Google skills were developed to a sufficient level in engineering school and fixing my problems only took a day or two.</p>
              <h4>Step 5: Create website files and upload to server</h4>
              <p>Finally, I was able to upload my website's appropriate files to the proper server and I had not tasted a victory so sweet in such a long time.</p>
              <h4>Step 6: Share it with others</h4>
              <p>Following, I linked my Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube accounts to my website, let everyone on those platforms know that JupiterMornings was now a thing, and let the feeling of success wash over me for a couple minutes.</p>
              <h4>Step 7: Continue learning and creating</h4>
              <p>Currently, JupiterMornings is not where I want it to be. I don't think it will ever be where I want it to be but I think that's also the point. My next steps moving forward are to learn JavaScript, get more comfortable recording video content, get accustomed to editing my videos to include text and other necessary effects. It's gonna be a cool ride from here on out so you should definitely stick around!</p>
